# fastLane (in development)
fastLane is a self hosted serverless password manager. Use only one password to get access to all of your passwords without storing all of them using a database. Uses a sha521 hashing algorithm to create a new password using your master password. This makes using a database to store your other passwords uncessesary and increases ease of use and security.
